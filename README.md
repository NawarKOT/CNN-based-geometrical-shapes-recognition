Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to create a model for recognizing geometric shapes. Four different models were designed, each varying in the number of layers, rows, and neurons per layer. Each network was trained on a dataset of images sized 200Ã—200 pixels after pre-processing. The models were then evaluated based on accuracy, and a comparison was made between them.
